Break down your solution into clear steps before writing the final code.\n    Description:\n    A. Helpful Maths\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation. The teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2 and 3. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+3. You've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum. Input The first line contains a non-empty string s \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the sum Xenia needs to count. String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters \"+\". Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2 and 3. String s is at most 100 characters long. Output Print the new sum that Xenia can count.\nExamples\nInput\n3+2+1\nOutput\n1+2+3\nInput\n1+1+3+1+3\nOutput\n1+1+1+3+3\nInput\n2\nOutput\n2\n\n\nInstructions:\n1.

Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III\n\nYou are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.\n\nFind the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.\n\nNote: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.\nThen buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.\nNote that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.\n\nInstructions:\n1.

Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II\nHard\nTopics\npremium lock icon\nCompanies\nSuppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times.

In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.\n\nYou are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.\n\nInitially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.\n\nPick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.\n\nThe answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.\nAfter finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.\nWith capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.\nSince you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.\nTherefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]\nOutput: 6\n\nInstructions:\n1.
